        <p>Though I have used html before, this project was a very helpful refresher on the syntax and core
                functionality of the language. It also introduced me to some best-practices for structuring and maintaining
                a web project, and introduced me to a number of features I was unaware of.

        <p>This project was very simple, so I didn't face any real difficulties, but I used it as an opportunity
            to set up my IDE with relevant key-binds and optimize the layout of the editor and tools.</p>

            <p>This project walked me through the basics of using Cascading Style Sheets to control the appearance of a
                webpage's elements. I did have a very strange issue with the heading font <code>Quicksand</code> not
                rendering on the site when it was deployed. I fixed the issue by making the font name lowercase.
                <em>By far the most painful debugging experience I have ever been party to.</em>

        <p>This project introduced the CSS techniques that define the layout of webpages.
            I was already somewhat familiar with the concepts used from looking over the CSS files provided
            in the other projects, but it was fun to get hands on with them and learn the nuances.

        <p>This project introduced HTML table entities and the basic CSS techniques used to style them.
            The most interesting part of the project for me was the portion that went over best-practices
            for displaying tables on mobile displays, and the difficulty inherent in rendering tables on small
            viewports.

        <p>This project introduced some new CSS features that allow more advanced graphic designs on web pages. I was
            already aware of most of them, but I did learn some new techniques with <code>transforms</code>, <code>
            rotations</code> <code>backgrounds</code>, and <code>maps</code>.
