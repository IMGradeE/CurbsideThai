            My favorite part of this project is that it will evolve over the course of the semester to reflect my
            journey through the material. I plan to include a gallery of each version of the site that I publish
            over the course of the semester to visually represent the evolution of my web design skills.

        <p>
            In this challenge I built 3 webpages, 2 of which vary only in style and layout, and the other being my
            tentative weekly schedule. I built the webpages entirely from the ground up, created a condensed version of
            one of the fonts for a heading, and used GIMP to create list item bullets, background images, and sample colors.

        </p>
        <p>
            This project was a bit exhausting to flesh out the way that I wanted. There was a tremendous amount of trial
            and error involved with making everything fit together the way that I wanted and getting the aesthetic I was
            going for. I do think it turned out well despite the limitations that pure css & html impose on a website
            though.

        <p>
            In this challenge I added extra graphic design to all the webpages on this site. I also added an imagemap to
            the headers that allows users to index through the webpages in a loop by clicking the left or right side of
            the header image.

        <p>
            In this challenge I created a web-form for a pet-competition. I also spent about 6 hours trying to figure
            out why my background images wouldn't render. Turns out, they were there the entire time, but not if I launched
            the page locally. Apparently the directory for the page is broken on my desktop, but it works perfectly fine
            inside my Github repo. 10/10.

        <h1><a class="interiorlink" href="../../arrays/arrays.html">Array Manipulation in Javascript</a></h1>
        <p>
            In this challenge I used javascript to define, display, and manipulate a number of arrays. I then scotch
            taped some css from another assignment onto the page and made some minor adjustments. It certainly could
            look better, but it looks good enough for me.

        <p>
            In this challenge I used javascript to create all the content on two pages. I did not really put any effort into
            making their appearance because finals are breathing down my neck and I need to manage my time appropriately.
            I may revisit this later.

        <p>
            In this challenge, I discovered that html's checkboxes do not natively indicate whether they are checked or
            unchecked. Seems like an oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seriously though, I used input/form handling in JS to make a registration form more responsive for users.
