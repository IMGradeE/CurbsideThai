        <p>Though I have used html before, this project was a very helpful refresher on the syntax and core
                functionality of the language. It also introduced me to some best-practices for structuring and maintaining
                a web project, and introduced me to a number of features I was unaware of.

        <p>This project was very simple, so I didn't face any real difficulties, but I used it as an opportunity
            to set up my IDE with relevant key-binds and optimize the layout of the editor and tools.</p>

            <p>This project walked me through the basics of using Cascading Style Sheets to control the appearance of a
                webpage's elements. I did have a very strange issue with the heading font <code>Quicksand</code> not
                rendering on the site when it was deployed. I fixed the issue by making the font name lowercase.

            I was already somewhat familiar with the concepts used from looking over the CSS files provided
            in the other projects, but it was fun to get hands on with them and learn the nuances.

        <p>This project introduced HTML table entities and the basic CSS techniques used to style them.
            The most interesting part of the project for me was the portion that went over best-practices
            for displaying tables on mobile displays, and the difficulty inherent in rendering tables on small
            viewports.

        <h1><a href="../../BridgerCollege/bc_const.html">Bridger College</a></h1>
        <p>In this activity I wrote a script that constructs and inserts the body's outline (table of contents) to a pre
            -defined element on the page (an aside, in this case). This is done by executing a breadth-first tree traversal
            that adds each heading element's text content to an anchor, links the anchor to the heading, and then adds the
            anchor as a list item to an ordered list. These ordered lists are nested according to their heading level (higher is deeper).
            This makes document navigation much easier, and can really only be improved by making the table of contents'
            have a fixed position on and allowing users to scroll through overflow content.</p>
