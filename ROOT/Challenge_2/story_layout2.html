                <h2>KNOCKED LOOSE</h2>
                <p>
                    Knocked Loose is a 5 member hardcore-punk/metalcore band from Oldham County, Kentucky.
                    To sum up their style in a single phrase, their music is "high-attack"; brutal, unrelenting,
                    tense, fast-paced, and emotional. Their music perfectly embodies and relates the sentiments present in
                    punk culture, refusing to be ignored, or to be complicit in oppressive systems and social hierarchies. The song that
                    introduced me to the band was <em>Oblivion's Peak</em>, and I haven't stopped listening since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The style described above has remained consistent over the now decade of recording and performing that the band have
                    engaged in, from their first EP <em>Pop Culture</em> which released in 2014, to their most recent 2023 LP
                    <em>Upon Loss</em>, the band has managed to give many elements of punk and straight edge cultures a voice that perfectly
                    embodies the sub-culture's intentions, outlooks, and goals.

                <p>
                    This band is much more difficult to pin down specifics regarding genre and style, but that's what makes them so
                    interesting. They definitely have an overall style that is consistent with the mathcore and metalcore genres, but
                    many of their songs borrow from multiple completely unrelated genres like jazz, classical, hyper-pop, and so on,
                    manifesting in what I would refer to as "truncated rhapsodies".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lack of strict adherence to the norms of any specific genre/subgenre enables them to fully leverage the
                    composition of each piece towards its narrative and motif. This is a constant across their discography, so any of
                    their releases would be a fitting example, but if you'd allow me to make a suggestion, it would be the track
                    <em>Star Baby</em> off of their most recent Studio Album <em>Celebrity Therapist</em>. Borrowing elements from various
                    genres to support the overall tonal-theme of dissonance and contempt towards the song's subject: regressive social
                    practices, and the contrived/inorganic public personas that perpetuate them.
                </p>

                    I have so much to say about this band that it's difficult to articulate anything without rambling, and I'm sure I've
                    already said more than most would be interested in reading, so I'll wrap this section up with another recommendation,
                    <em>A Brief Article Regarding Time Loops</em>, which is the song that introduced me to their terrific body of work.
